# Big-Data-Architecture

Goal: Develop and describe a prototype of a Data Pipeline,
addressing Data Ingestion, Data Storage and Data Processing/Visualization

Data Ingestion
§ Either from API call
§ Or from a data stream 

Data Storage
§ Use Cloud Services for the pipeline and its components
§ For example, Google Cloud Platform, Confluent Kafka

Data processing and visualization
§ Queries with Aggregation
§ Display of results: as table and/or with simple visualizations
